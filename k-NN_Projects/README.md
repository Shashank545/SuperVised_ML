## Description
This is a concise compilation of k-NN based Machine Learning assignments along with related datasets. I have taken a very basic step-by-step approach to help anyone understand without any hassle..

## Dependencies to execute the notebook:
1. Python 3.6.x
2. Pip installation manager
3. Jupyter Notebook
4. Numpy
5. Pandas
6. Matplotlib
7. Seaborn


## k-NN in Short
An object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
