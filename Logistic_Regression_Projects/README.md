#Types of Logistic Regression

1. Binary Logistic Regression
The categorical response has only two 2 possible outcomes. Example: Spam or Not
2. Multinomial Logistic Regression
Three or more categories without ordering. Example: Predicting which food is preferred more (Veg, Non-Veg, Vegan)
3. Ordinal Logistic Regression
Three or more categories with ordering. Example: Movie rating from 1 to 5
