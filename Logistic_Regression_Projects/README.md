This is a concise dossier of Logistic Regression based Machine Learning assignments along with related datasets. I have taken a very basic step-by-step approach to help anyone understand it with ease.

## Dependencies to execute the notebook:
1) Python 3.6.x
2) Pip installation manager
3) Jupyter Notebook
4) Numpy
5) Pandas
6) Matplotlib
7) Seaborn


## Types of Logistic Regression

1. Binary Logistic Regression
The categorical response has only two 2 possible outcomes. Example: Spam or Not
2. Multinomial Logistic Regression
Three or more categories without ordering. Example: Predicting which food is preferred more (Veg, Non-Veg, Vegan)
3. Ordinal Logistic Regression
Three or more categories with ordering. Example: Movie rating from 1 to 5
